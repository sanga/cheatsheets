Some of these are down to my particular configuration

```
$ goto end
~ goto first non-ws char
n next search hit
N prev search hit
d/rails delete until the text "rails"
ma mark current point as "a"
'a goto the mark "a"
"*yy and "+yy copy current line to system clipboard
leader j = join lines
:%norm A* insert * to all lines (i.e. run "A*" on all lines)
:norm 0itim prepend visual selection with "tim"```
